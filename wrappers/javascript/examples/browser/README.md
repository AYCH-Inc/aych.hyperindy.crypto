# Indy Crypto Browser Example
This is an example of using the Indy Crypto library in the web browser. It requires Webpack
in order to make a JavaScript bundle which can load the Indy Crypto bindings, as this has
good support for loading WASM generated by wasm-bindgen. Notice that the Indy Crypto
library must be imported
[asynchronously](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import), as this
is required for loading a Webpack bundle containing WASM.

To try this example, do the following:

1. `pushd ../.. && npm run build && popd`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. `./server.py`
5. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser of choice
